            <h1>Haarlem</h1>
            <h2 class="mb-3">for families and children</h2>
            <p>Haarlem combines historic charm with a cultural edge and a food and
                drink scene to rival any big city. And, of course, its location on
                the edge of the coastal dunes means that the lure of the sea is never
                far away. With many families moving from Amsterdam to Haarlem for more space,
                it’s no wonder that the city has such a kid-friendly feel. Whether you’re visiting
                Haarlem with the kids or you’re a current resident looking for family days out in the
                city, here are a few suggestions to get you started.</p>

                        ABC Architectuurcentrum, a centre for architecture with its very own LEGO room. With so many bricks,
                        kids can play and build to their heart’s content. But don’t forget the exhibitions about the architecture
                        of Haarlem and surroundings: In the Haarlemzaal you'll even find scale models, construction drawings and
                        3D-printed buildings.

                    <p>If you were to build a theatre out of the dreams of children,
                        it would probably look something like the Kindertheater De Toverknol.
                        As well as offering a magical new show each month, before each performance
                        kids get to transform into princesses, pirates or whatever character they might
                        like to become for the day from the theatre’s special racks of dressing up outfits.
                        On top of that, Kindertheater de Toverknol hosts birthday parties, and offers acting
                        workshops and dance and music lessons.

                        Tante Steef (Aunty Steef) and Krokodil (crocodile) also offer a great selection
                        of kids’ toys big and small, with a see-saw outside Tante Steef and a fun slide inside Krokodil.
